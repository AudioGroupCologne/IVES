# IVES
IVES - Interactive Virtual Environment System: A modular toolkit for 3D audiovisual composition in Max

The "Interactive Virtual Environment System" (IVES) is a toolkit aiding the composition of immersive audiovisual 3D virtual environments. It can be used for screen-based or virtual reality (VR) applications with loudspeaker- or headphone-based spatial audio reproduction. 
The toolkit is developed within the Cycling´74s Max programming environment and uses the programming libraries Jitter / OpenGL (Cycling’74), Spat (IRCAM), VR (Graham Wakefield) into ready-to-use abstractions with graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

<br>

## Required Dependencies
The toolbox was implemented in Max 8 (v.8.1.10) and requires additonal libraries. Besides the in Max 8 integrated Jitter library, these third party libraries need to be
installed for IVES to work: 

- [Spat 5](https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/spat/) (Spatial audio library by IRCAM)
- [VR](https://github.com/worldmaking/vr) (VR library, can also be installed via the Max Package Manager. Only needed for use with PC-VR hardware.)


<br>

## Installation
Download and place the package into the default Max Packages folder. (Windows: My Documents/Max 8/Packages; Mac: ~/Documents/Max 8/Packages).
Make sure the required dependencies are installed correctly. 


<br>

## Use

The IVES modules are implemented as Max clippings. Paste them to your Max patcher window with right-click -> Paste From -> IVES -> *choose your module*
